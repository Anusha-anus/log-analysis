## Linux log file

Linux logs are usually located at /var/log/. The dataset was collected from /var/log/messages on a Linux server over a period of 260+ days, as part of the Public Security Log Sharing Site project.

# Log File Monitoring and Analysis Script

This Python script automates the monitoring and analysis of log files in real-time. It continuously monitors a specified log file for new entries, performs analysis on the log data, and can trigger alerts based on specified conditions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3 installed on your system
- Access to the log file you want to monitor

## Dependencies

- None

## Usage

1. Clone or download the script `log_monitor.py` to your local machine.
2. Open the script in a text editor and update the `log_file_path` variable with the path to the log file you want to monitor.
3. Customize the `analyze_log(log_data)` function according to your analysis requirements.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
5. Run the script using the following command:

6. The script will start monitoring the specified log file. It will continuously analyze new log entries and print the analysis results in the terminal.

## Testing

To test the script, you can perform the following steps:

1. Generate some test log entries in the log file you're monitoring.
2. Ensure that the script is running and actively monitoring the log file.
3. Observe the script's output in the terminal. It should display real-time analysis results based on the new log entries.

## Example

For example, if your log file contains error messages, you can customize the `analyze_log(log_data)` function to count the number of errors and trigger an alert if a certain threshold is exceeded.

```python
def analyze_log(log_data):
    error_count = log_data.count('ERROR')
    if error_count > 5:
        print("ALERT: High number of errors detected!")
This will trigger an alert in the terminal whenever the number of 'ERROR' entries exceeds 5 within the analyzed log data.

Errors: 6, Warnings: 2
ALERT: High number of errors detected!
